## lib_mysqludf_stomp

A MySQL UDF library to send STOMP messages to a message broker.
Supports authentication using the stompsend2 function (see details below).

## Instructions for Ubuntu

### Install Dependencies
In order do compile the plugin, you need to install Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and MySQL client development packages.

`sudo apt-get install gcc libapr1 libapr1-dev libmysqlclient-dev`

### Compile & Install
To install the UDF, just run the provided install script which will compile and install the library.
The MySQL root password will be requested for installing.

`sudo ./install.sh`

#### If you get errors of missing libraries, edit the Makefile and make sure the paths are correct for your system.

### Using the functions

The plugin will provide you with 3 new functions you can use in your queries.
All of them take the same first 3 parameters (Hostname, Topic, Message) and the others are headers.
For authentication you must use `stompsend2`.
All parameters are strings :

- stompsend(Hostname, Topic, Message);
- stompsend1(Hostname, Topic, Message, HeaderName, HeaderValue);
- stompsend2(Hostname, Topic, Message, Header1Name, Header1Value, Header2Name, Header2Value);

### Example
To send the message "Hello broker" to the "Welcome" topic on server "127.0.0.1", just use :

`SELECT stompsend("127.0.0.1","Welcome", "Hello broker");`

If everything went well, you should get and "OK" response, else you will get a NULL:

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
| stompsend("127.0.0.1","Welcome", "Hello broker") |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| OK                                               |
+--------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

If you need to authenticate, you can use the `stompsend2` function with the "login" and "passcode" as headers.
This function was modified in this fork to allow authentication by sending the headers on the CONNECT frame.

`SELECT stompsend2("127.0.0.1","Welcome", "Hello broker", "login","guest","passcode","mypass");`

If the credentials are invalid, you should receive the body of the message sent by the broker (ex: "Access refused for client 'guest'.").
